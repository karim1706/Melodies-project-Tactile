# Melodies-project-Tactile

That little project is an app which let you play piano melodies. It was made on october 2020.

The language I worked with is Javascript Vanilla.

  * 14th October 2020 : V1 of the App = it works only on desktop
  * 22nd October 2020 : V2 of the App = it works on Desktop and mobile phones ( but the click on the piano key effect doesn't work)
  * 24th October 2020 : V3 = it works on the Desktop and mobile phones (the click effect works now).
